## Pizza Delivery App
I have developed this react native app using typescript. this app contains a basic home page with details of the resturant and inside each resturant we can add the food items to the cart. The cart will show all the items in the respective resturants. And then we can click order and will be redirected to the home page again.

# Bonus
1. Basic Styling - for all the pages
2. Expo Haptics - for immersive user experience
3. BottomSheet - Modal presentation view, Bottom Sheet Modal. Smooth gesture interactions & snapping animations. Seamless keyboard handling for iOS & Android.
4. ParallaxScrollView - implemented parallaxscrollview on the details page. A component that enables the creation of a scrollable view with a parallax effect. This effect creates a sense of depth and immersion by making the background image move at a slower rate than the foreground content.
5. Zustand State Management - Zustand is a lightweight and flexible state management library for React applications.
